# DynamicA3 - Better Bridge
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Better bridge is an extention for chrome based browsers that aims to create a better user experience on the University of Lethbridge's "bridge" site. As the site is originally made up of simple text and hyper links, the site can be quite boring and sometimes even difficult to navigate.</p>
